# Snips Android Demo
A demo of the Snips Platform for Android

This shows basic integration of the snips platform in an Android application.

## Compiling 

A simple 
```
$ ./gradlew installDebug
```
should install the demo on a connected device

> If you see errors while connecting to `nexus.snips.ai` upgrade you java to a recent version (we're using Let's Encrypt for our SSL certificates and older version of java do not support it)

## Running

Make sure you have an unzipped snips assistant in the folder `snips_android_assistant` at the root of the external storage on you Android. You can create and download assistants on the [Snips Console](https://console.snips.ai)

You can copy the files with adb :

```
unzip your_assistant.zip
adb push assistant/* /sdcard/snips_android_assistant/
```


Click the `start` button in the app to start the `snips-platform`.

Current implementation is completly dumb and show the detected hotword/intents. A simple TTS is said when an intent is detected.
